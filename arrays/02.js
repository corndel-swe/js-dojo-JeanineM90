Similar to 01, but it's the last two items of the array
Use prev code and change index number

This didn't work:

âœ” should return the sum of the last two prices
    1) should work with different price values    
    2) should handle arrays with only two prices

So checked example solution for pointers/ comparison:

export function endSum(prices) {
  const last = prices[prices.length - 1]
  const secondLast = prices[prices.length - 2]
  return last + secondLast
}

This uses length- see this in "basics" of array tech doc
Why? If you don't know how many items are in the array- we don't need to count, but we know we need the last and 2nd to last
This would be lenth -1 etc
A cleaner way, and still returns what we need- I was too specifc with "fourth and fifth"
